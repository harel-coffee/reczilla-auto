### prepare_metadataset.ipynb

This notebook creates a meta-dataset for all RecZilla experiments, using aggregated output from all experiments. The only input to this notebook is a CSV produced by the script `process_inbox.py` -- this script reads all zipped results from gcloud and creates an aggregated CSV.
